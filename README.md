# TriviaGame

### Overview

Homework assignment focusing primarily on JavaScript and jQuery. 

In this assignment, we were asked to create a Trivia Game using JavaScript for the logic, jQuery to manipulate HTML, and Time-Out functions to set time limit. 

Requrements include: creating a trivia game that shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.

### Summary

I decided to have 'Pokemon' as my theme (first generation). Once you start the game, the pokemon game boy theme song will play. You will have 20 seconds for each question. Once you enter, the screen will tell you if you are wrong or correct with an animated gif for 3 seconds. At the end, you will view your results as well as have an option to restart the game. 

A little flashback for all you old school pokemon game boy players out there!
